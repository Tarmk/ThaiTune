# Simple Email Integration Options 🚀

You didn't want to use Gmail API or Freshdesk, so here are the simple alternatives I've set up:

## ✅ **Option 1: IMAP Email Reading** (READY TO USE!)

**What's been set up:**
- ✅ `lib/email-reader.ts` - reads emails via IMAP
- ✅ `app/api/check-emails/route.ts` - API endpoint
- ✅ Admin panel updated with "Check Emails" button
- ✅ `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - complete setup instructions

**How to use:**
1. **Add email config to `.env.local`** (see `email-config-template.txt`)
2. **For Gmail**: Create app password in Google Account settings
3. **Test**: Send email to `support@yourdomain.com` with subject `Re: [TT-123456-ABC123] Test`
4. **Click "Check Emails"** in admin panel
5. **Done!** Reply appears in ticket

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works with any email provider
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Simple setup (just email credentials)
- ✅ You control everything

## 📧 **Option 2: Email Forwarding** (Zero setup)

**How it works:**
1. Forward `support@yourdomain.com` to your Gmail
2. Use Gmail filters to label support emails
3. Handle manually until you need automation

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No setup required
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No technical complexity

## 🔄 **Option 3: Other Services**

**Mailgun or Postmark** - both have simple email-to-webhook conversion

## 🎯 **My Recommendation:**

**Use Option 1 (IMAP)** - it's ready to go! Just:
1. Add email config to `.env.local`
2. Test with a ticket
3. Click "Check Emails" in admin

**Or if you want even simpler**: Use Option 2 (email forwarding) for now.

## 📁 **Files Created:**
- `lib/email-reader.ts` - IMAP email processing
- `app/api/check-emails/route.ts` - API endpoint
- `EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - detailed setup guide
- `email-config-template.txt` - environment variables

## 🚀 **Next Steps:**
1. Copy `email-config-template.txt` to your `.env.local`
2. Set up your email credentials
3. Test with a support ticket
4. Click "Check Emails" button in admin panel

That's it! Much simpler than Gmail API or external platforms! 🎉
